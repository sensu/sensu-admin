== Sensu Admin

Sensu-admin is a web application to interface with the sensu-api, it displays
events and clients and can silence events etc.

== Getting Started

rake db:migrate
rake db:seed

Make sure your post-deploy task runs "whenever --update-crontab from the rails cwd"

The seed file creates a user account named admin@example.com with a password of secret.

== Database

sensu-admin uses the database very lightly, so you can use sqlite instead of mysql. bundling --without mysql will not require the mysql libraries.
The User, Downtime and Log models are all that use the database currently so unless you have very high throughput it should result in little usage.

== TODO

=== High Priority
* Fix cookbook for deployment
* Settings displaying environments, api settings
* Silence events en mass

=== Medium Priority
* Lazy load events, clients, etc in mobile
* Silence all
* Use sensu config for production sensu-admin -- https://github.com/sensu/sensu/blob/master/lib/sensu/settings.rb
* Do not render out all modals into the html, do like you do with the main modal on events and render via ajax
* Make sure that downtimes and silence events have pre defined descriptions that you can set (dropdown)
* Fix bug where if a check output has no spaces it can blow out the list (because it will not wrap)
* Add keepalive into downtime checks

=== Low Priority
* Make a downtime info page
* Log Downtime schedule, execution, and completion
* Silence based on an attribute (es, rs)
* Make the JQuery mobile version auto-update events if possible
* Move mobile and desktop assets into their own directories and cleanup
* Notify the user if whenever cronjobs have not run recently, namely when scheduling a downtime.
