== Sensu Admin

Sensu-admin is a web application to interface with the sensu-api, it displays
events and clients and can silence events etc.

== Getting Started

rake db:migrate
rake db:seed

Make sure your post-deploy task runs "whenever --update-crontab from the rails cwd"

The seed file creates a user account named admin@example.com with a password of secret.

== Database

sensu-admin uses the database very lightly, so you can use sqlite instead of mysql. bundling --without mysql will not require the mysql libraries.
The User, Downtime and Log models are all that use the database currently so unless you have very high throughput it should result in little usage.

== TODO
* Settings for api, rabbitmq, etc
* RabbitMQ dashboard, health of everything
* permission
* add/remove users
* Log Downtime schedule, execution, and completion
* Make a downtime info page
* popover in events looks like crap on small or huge screens
* Use sensu config for production sensu-admin -- https://github.com/sensu/sensu/blob/master/lib/sensu/settings.rb
* Make a note when silencing or creating a downtime that event handlers must use sensu-plugin or hit the API to check for silencing
* Do not render out all modals into the html, do like you do with the main modal on events and render via ajax
* Full jquery mobile support
* Try and fix the events table magnifying glass so it doesnt wrap and acts better
